PlaceFinder

PlaceFinder is a mobile web app used to explore places around your current location, within a radius of your choice. It uses the browser's geolocation services along with FourSquare's API to query recommended nearby places. Key details of each place (name, category, and distance) are presented in a list. When a place is selected, its address (to copy into a navigation app) and, if it exists, the place's website (to learn more about it) are presented to the user.

PlaceFinder was built with react and styled with sass. It is hosted on github pages at: https://lhenn.github.io/place-finder/#/
